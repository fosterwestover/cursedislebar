    <h1>Tiki bars are back in style.</h1>
    <h2>Cursed Isle Tiki Bar coming to Culver City in 2022.</h2>
    <p>Tiki bars are getting a new name for themselves. What was once considered a gimmick in the sixties and seventies is getting rebranded with a new look more fitting for the 21st century. Mixing the traditional aspects that made tiki bars loved and adored in the first place with a contemporary aesthetic will result in a bar experience that evokes both nostalgia for the past and excitement for the present. Soon, Angelenos will be able to feel as if they are stepping foot onto a tropical island, without ever leaving the city. </p>
